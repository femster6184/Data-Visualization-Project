## Project 3 - Weather Visualization dashboard
### Team 6 - Oliver, Femi, Carlos, Darrick, Susan

### Project Overview/ Description

The purpose of this project is to provide insights and data visualizations of different weather patterns and trends by analyzing and comparing weather data of various cities/regions around the world.  Data analysis and visualization tools will be used to understand weather data such as, air quality, temperature, solar/lunar information, visibility, etc.

We plan to use the project track - dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data.

We are working with this weather dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository

We will investigate the following questions:
1. (Darrick) How does air quality differ by location?
2. (Susan) How do latitude and longitude affect temperature and wind speed?
3. (Oliver) How do latitude and longitude affect precipitation frequency and magnitude?
4. (Carlos) Does cloud cover have an affect on air quality?
5. (Femi) Does air quality affect levels of moon illumination?

By answering these questions, we hope to improve our understanding of how these variables work together to impact our climate. Analyzing past data can help us get insight into how the future might look. Visualizing our findings makes it easier to spot patterns and understand the subtle relationships/ interactions in the dataset.

### Startup & Use
